# Digital Scholarly Editing: A Practical Guide with *Walden*

We're using this repo to develop our site on [digital scholarly editing](https://milnegeneseo.github.io/digital-scholarly-editing). The site is served from the `docs` directory. Right now everything is *very much* under construction.

We're using the Jekyll theme known as [Ed](https://github.com/minicomp/ed).
