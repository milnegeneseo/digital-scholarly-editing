title: The </em>Walden</em> manuscript
---

In light of Thoreau's repeated and extensive re-workings of his initial conception, some scholars have argued that its meaning can't be found by reading the published words alone but only through a careful examination of its progressive evolution in relation to the biographical evolution that accompanied it. *Walden*, on this view, is as much the record of that evolution as its triumphant end result. In the words of Robert Sattelmeyer, "*Walden* is, in this respect, an archetypal Romantic text, like [Walt Whitman's] *Leaves of Grass*, that developed as its author developed and that preserves experience while continually re-interpreting it" ("The Remaking of *Walden*," 75).

Perhaps we might say the same of any text that's undergone significant revision, especially over an extended period of time. It's hard to imagine that such a text would *not* reflect the author's own ambivalence, vacillation, and shifts of vision and purpose against the background of an ongoing life. As we saw earlier, such is in fact the premise of both [genetic scholarly editing](/editing/types-of-scholarly-editing#genetic-editing) and [fluid-text editing](/editing/types-of-scholarly-editing#fluid-text-editing). What makes *Walden* different from "any" heavily revised text isn't that it evolves but rather, first, that we have so complete a record of its evolution and, second, that readers care about it deeply enough to want to understand how it became what it is.

Together, the record and the care brought Ronald E. Clapper, a PhD candidate in English Literature at UCLA, to the Huntington Library in the 1960s to study HM 924, the manuscript of *Walden*. In the years since, scholars like Sattelmeyer who've argued for an evolutionary interpretation of *Walden* have routinely relied on Clapper's 1967 dissertation, "The Development of *Walden*: A Genetic Text."

For his genetic edition of *Walden*, Clapper devised a set of symbols to indicate places where Thoreau inserted or canceled words and phrases and to distinguish between insertions made in ink and pencil. We can recognize these symbols as a kind of homegrown markup language. Clapper's markup even employs angle brackets — though in a very different way from XML. Here's an example of his code:


<blockquote style="font-style:normal;">
<h3 style="color:#000;">Economy 2a &nbsp;written: A; rewritten: C,C</h3>  
<p>I should not obtrude my affairs so much on the notice of my readers<sup>6</sup> if very particular<sup>7</sup> inquiries had not been made by my townsmen<sup>8</sup> concerning my mode of life, which<sup>9</sup> some would call impertinent, though they do not appear to me at all impertinent, but, considering the circumstances, very natural and pertinent<sup>10</sup>.</p>
<hr style="border-top:1px solid black;" />
<p><sup>6</sup><em>obtrude my affairs so much on the notice of my readers</em> [A:] presume to talk so much about myself and my affairs as I shall in this &lt;lecture&gt; &lt;&uparrow;book&downarrow;&gt; &lt;&uparrow;work&downarrow;&gt;book [C2:] obtrude &lt;myself and&gt; my affairs so much on the notice of my readers</p>
<p><sup>7</sup><em>particular</em> [A:] particular and personal</p>
</blockquote>

<!-- We can recognize this developmental or evolutionary approach to understanding *Walden* as the same one that [genetic scholarly editing](/editing/types-of-scholarly-editing#genetic-editing) and [fluid-text editing](/editing/types-of-scholarly-editing#fluid-text-editing) take toward texts in general. Where there's a manuscript that preserves a text's process of becoming, a complete understanding of the text will require us to follow that process. 

Whether we come to the *Walden* manuscript seeking to re-focus our understanding of a classic or to illustrate the general proposition that a text's being — whether a Romantic one or not — resides in its becoming (and we can do both at once), our starting point has to be the manuscript as an object. To understand it as an object, we have to build a model of it: to describe it *as a thing* and to describe *the things within it*, such as the types of structural and conceptual features we discussed on the previous page.

That's exactly what Ronald E. Clapper set out to do in his 1967 PhD dissertation, "The Development of *Walden*: A Genetic Text." He did it without computers (which existed at the time but not in a form that would have helped him) and without XML (which did not yet exist). He did it using something we can recognize as *markup*, even though he didn't call it that.
