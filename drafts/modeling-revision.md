title: The *Walden* manuscript
---

The *Walden* manuscript has interested scholars for many years as a source of insight into the meaning of a signal work of American literature.

In light of Thoreau's repeated and extensive re-workings of his initial conception, some scholars have argued that its meaning can't be found by reading the published words alone but only through a careful examination of its progressive evolution in relation to the biographical evolution that accompanied it. *Walden*, on this view, is as much the record of that evolution as its triumphant end result. In the words of Robert Sattelmeyer, "*Walden* is, in this respect, an archetypal Romantic text, like [Walt Whitman's] *Leaves of Grass*, that developed as its author developed and that preserves experience while continually re-interpreting it" ("The Remaking of *Walden*," 75).

We can recognize this developmental or evolutionary approach to understanding *Walden* as the same one that [genetic scholarly editing](/editing/types-of-scholarly-editing#genetic-editing) and [fluid-text editing](/editing/types-of-scholarly-editing#fluid-text-editing) take toward texts in general. Where there's a manuscript that preserves a text's process of becoming, a complete understanding of the text will require us to follow that process. 

Whether we come to the *Walden* manuscript seeking to re-focus our understanding of a classic or to illustrate the general proposition that a text's being — whether a Romantic one or not — resides in its becoming (and we can do both at once), our starting point has to be the manuscript as an object. To understand it as an object, we have to build a model of it: to describe it *as a thing* and to describe *the things within it*, such as the types of structural and conceptual features we discussed on the previous page.

That's exactly what Ronald E. Clapper set out to do in his 1967 PhD dissertation, "The Development of *Walden*: A Genetic Text." He did it without computers (which existed at the time but not in a form that would have helped him) and without XML (which did not yet exist). He did it using something we can recognize as *markup*, even though he didn't call it that.
