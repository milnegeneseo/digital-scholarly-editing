# Scholarly Editing Module Draft Document: July 27, 2020

## \[Paul’s new outline, modified\]

\#Walden MSS Module

These modules take as their principal example text Henry David Thoreau’s seven manuscript drafts for Walden, which was published in 1854. The bulk of the drafts is owned by the Huntington Library; on their [<span class="underline">website</span>](https://hdl.huntington.org/digital/collection/p16003coll16) you will find high-resolution scans of each page in their collection.

\#\#The Composition of Walden

In 1845, Thoreau built a small house near the shore of Walden Pond in Concord, Massachusetts, on land owned by his neighbor Ralph Waldo Emerson. He moved in on July 4, 1845, and moved back to town on September 6, 1847. The house was his writer’s retreat: there he finished a draft of his first book, A Week on the Concord and Merrimack RIvers, and began his second, Walden.

The first draft, which Thoreau worked on between late 1846 and September 1847, is closest to a complete version. \[Reference The Making of Walden here; could we get permission to link to an image of these pages?\] From mid-1848 into March 1854, Thoreau developed his book through six more stages. (The final version, which Thoreau sent to the printer piecemeal beginning in March 1854, is no longer extant.) None of the drafts is complete in itself, and from the second draft on, each is made up of some combination of new material, existing material copied onto new leaves, and leaves or portions of leaves moved from earlier drafts into later ones. In other words, the surviving Walden manuscript is a mash-up of seven different phases of Thoreau’s thinking, planning, and writing on 628 sheets of various kinds of paper.

\#\#The Transmission of the Walden Manuscript (and other Thoreau manuscripts) from 1862 to 1918

Thoreau died on May 6, 1862, leaving all of his manuscripts to his sister Sophia. When she moved to Bangor, Maine, in 1873, she left the manuscripts with Bronson Alcott, in Concord. Until then, the Walden manuscript probably retained the order in which Thoreau had left it.

Sophia left the manuscripts with Alcott in 1873, 1874, and 1875. She learned that Alcott had allowed Franklin Benjamin Sanborn to borrow items (and she must have known that William Ellery Channing, with whom Sophia had fallen out, could have had access to them at Sanborn's home), and in 1875, she asked Alcott to put all the manuscripts in the town library (now the Concord Free Public Library) with Emerson as trustee.

Before she died in October 1876, Sophia decided that the manuscripts (with the exception of Thoreau’s surveys and his surveying field notes, which she gave to the library) should go to Harrison Gray Otis Blake, who had been a disciple, correspondent, and friend of Thoreau’s. In December 1876 Emerson sent two trunks of manuscripts to Blake

Blake, who lived in Worcester, had the manuscripts until his death in 1898. We know he gave away parts of letters containing Thoreau's signature as mementos; he could have done this with fragments of the Walden manuscript as well.

Elias Harlow Russell, who cared for Blake in his last years in Worcester, inherited the manuscripts from Blake. Russell then went to court and secured a decree of absolute ownership of this inheritance. To Houghton MIfflin he sold the publishing rights for the Journal, and he made an arrangement for Houghton Mifflin to purchase several hundred loose manuscript leaves, including leaves from the Walden drafts, to be tipped into six hundred volumes of a special set of Thoreau’s complete works (the Manuscript Edition).

In 1904 Russell sold all but the manuscripts of the Journal volumes to the New York dealer George Hellman. Whatever order the manuscripts were in when Hellman acquired them was lost when he sorted them into published and unpublished material and early and late drafts, based on his incomplete understanding of their relationships to Thoreau’s books and essays. He also had some groups of manuscripts bound in leather, misidentifying at least one group. (Howarth, *Literary Manuscripts of HDT*, xxiv)

Hellman disposed of the manuscripts in three groups. As had been previously arranged through Russell, Houghton Mifflin received between three and four hundred leaves to tip into the Manuscript Edition sets. William Augustus White, a New York collector, bought almost 400 miscellaneous leaves in late 1904. William Keeney Bixby, a St. Louis collector, bought all the unconsigned manuscripts, including the Walden manuscript, in August 1905. (*LMHDT*, xxv)

Bixby hired Sanborn to "examine, identify, and transcribe" the manuscripts he had bought: Sanborn vandalized the manuscripts, marking them in ink, graphite pencil, and colored pencil, and in some cases typing on them. Sanborn persuaded Bixby to finance the 1909 Bibliophile Edition of *Walden*, to which he added material from the draft manuscript, as well as his own commentary. For the Bibliophile Edition Sanborn marked the Walden manuscript for correspondence with the 1889 Houghton Mifflin edition of *Walden*. J. Lyndon Shanley says Sanborn "more than likely" was responsible for the order of the MS pages in which Shanley found them at the Huntington (*Making of* Walden, *with the Text of the First Edition* \[1957\], p. 3).

As for the Journal, Houghton Mifflin held onto the manuscript volumes until late 1906, using them to proofread copy for the 1906 edition. In 1907, the manuscript volumes were returned to Russell, who sold them to Hellman. Hellman sold them to Stephen Wakeman, a New York collector, and Wakeman sold them to J. Pierpont Morgan in 1916. They have been at the Morgan Library ever since.

\#\#The Walden Manuscript at the Huntington

According to the Huntington’s [<span class="underline">catalog record</span>](https://catalog.huntington.org/record=b1852065), Henry E. Huntington purchased Bixby’s collection of Walden drafts in 1918. An unknown number of leaves of the drafts were not part of Bixby’s acquisition: they had been sold either by Russell to Houghton MIfflin or by Hellman to another collector, William Augustus White. About fifty of these leaves have turned up since then in the collections of seventeen libraries in the United States, and those of a number of private collectors.

It's not uncommon for libraries to mark manuscripts to indicate ownership and discourage theft. I don't know what might have been done with these manuscripts at the Huntington in the way of ownership marking.

The current organization of the leaves of the Walden manuscript is the work of the Thoreau scholar J. Lyndon Shanley. The fullest account of Shanley’s work is in his *Making of* Walden, *with the Text of the First Edition* (1957).

In *Making*, Shanley notes a "brief, unpublished paper" by Odell Shepard about "some of the revisions he had traced" in the *Walden* manuscript (*Making*, p. 2). (*PMLA* for 1936 lists this paper as "The Manuscripts of Thoreau's *Walden*," delivered at the MLA meeting on December 30, 1936. Unless Shepard had access to photostats, he must have used the originals.) Shanley began his own study with black and white photostats of the whole manuscript, “thinking only that unpublished material in it would be useful for an annotated edition of *Walden*” (*Making*, p. 2). Using the photostats, he assembled different versions of "a number of passages” (*Making*, p. 2), but until he went to the Huntington to check his transcriptions against the original he had no idea that individual drafts could be identified.

With the manuscript leaves before him at the library, however, Shanley found that he could use "the color and size of paper, ink, and handwriting, and the stationer's marks" as well as contents to sort the leaves into "seven large groups of leaves and two smaller ones" numbered I to IX (*Making*, p. 4). He describes the organization of the leaves after he had arranged them: "The manuscript (HM 924) in the Huntington Library is distributed in eight envelopes, and the leaves of group VIII are distributed among the envelopes containing groups I-VII, according to the relations of these leaves to the major groups" (*Making*, p. 13, note 24). The Huntington replaced roman numerals with letters; groups I-VII are now usually known as A-G. An additional group labeled "IX" by Shanley and described by him as containing notes for *Walden* is also known as pre-A; in the Huntington accession scheme it is called “Additional Material, separate from drafts (Huntington Volume 8).”

As far as I know, Ronald Clapper is the only other scholar to deal with the entire *Walden* manuscript; he did so while working at the Huntington in the 1960s on his dissertation, "The Development of *Walden*: A Genetic Text" (1967). Clapper was allowed to work with the originals, but by then use was carefully supervised and he would not have been able to rearrange or mark the MSS.

The current catalog record notes that the original is now available by special permission only. Those without permission are required to use the library's facsimile reproduction.

\[Here I had intended a short description of Clapper’s genetic text of Walden and its relationship to the Fluid Text Edition. You’ve done that in [<span class="underline">https://digitalthoreau.org/fluid-text-toc/</span>](https://digitalthoreau.org/fluid-text-toc/), and material there could be imported into this document if that’s desirable. BW 9/30/20\]

\#\#[<span class="underline">Walden: A Fluid Text Edition</span>](https://digitalthoreau.org/fluid-text-toc/)

\[The second reason that the Walden manuscript is such a useful example for these modules is that there exists a long history of scholarly editing attached to the manuscript. For more than a century, scholarly editors have been fascinated by the multi-layered, mash-up qualities of the Walden manuscript and have worked to figure out the order of and relationship between individual pages of the manuscript so as to trace the development of Thoreau’s thinking and writing. This has been no easy task: after Thoreau’s death, individual pages of the Walden manuscript were separated and scattered across various collections. \[Indeed, some pages remain in private collections, some might still be hidden away in unexplored archives, and some are probably lost forever—one final copy of the manuscript that Thoreau made for his printer, for example, has never been found.\] However, scholarly editors and archivists have made an incredible effort to collect the Walden pages back together again and to make sense of how those pages combine to form different evolutions of Thoreau’s thinking. This effort offers us a unique opportunity to explore the modern history of scholarly editing, especially in its transition from non-digital to digital approaches.\]

\[The third reason that the Walden manuscript is such a useful example for these modules is the remarkable fact that the Huntington library has recently made high-resolution scans of each extant page of the manuscript available for public viewing. It is difficult to overstate the cultural and scholarly value of these scans. While nothing compares to the visceral experience of seeing manuscript pages like these in person, the Huntington scans offer us an unprecedented level of detail with which to examine every pen stroke, every pinhole, every smudge, and every mark of movement and combination on the sheets that make up the Walden manuscript.\]

\#Scholarly Editing Module

\[NOTE: this is a kind of thinking-aloud as to how we might invite readers into the world of digital scholarly editing. This isn’t yet the punchy hook I’m imagining, but here goes anyway\! (Lots of known problems here: entanglement of book/text, oversimplification of things, insufficient intro of digital, etc., etc.)\]

Books and manuscripts are remarkable things. Like us, they have dual natures; they exist in both the physical and the immaterial realms, and we engage with them in both. We encounter them as physical objects--we enjoy their texture and heft and scent. When we read the texts they contain, we operate in the immaterial world of attention, thought, and imagination. Both their corporeal and incorporeal features enable them to transport ideas and information through time and across distance, allowing us to explore the past and encouraging us to envision the future.

Books and manuscripts are also exciting and mysterious in ways you may never have considered. They respond to the detective work that scholarly editors do by giving up secrets about who made them and about how and when they were made.

\#\#Secrets of Books

Books are very good at disguising the complex, messy conditions of their making: they hide how they’ve come to be.

We’re accustomed to thinking about a book as the outcome of one individual’s writing efforts. The Romantic trope of the impoverished writer, wrestling in solitude to capture in words some inspired perspective on the human condition, remains a powerful one. \[links to examples of this trope? [<span class="underline">https://www.phrases.org.uk/bulletin\_board/55/messages/780.html</span>](https://www.phrases.org.uk/bulletin_board/55/messages/780.html) [<span class="underline">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Death\_of\_Chatterton\#:~:text=The%20Death%20of%20Chatterton%20is,now%20in%20Tate%20Britain%2C%20London.\&text=The%20Tate%20painting%20measures%2062.2,and%20was%20completed%20in%201856</span>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_of_Chatterton#:~:text=The%20Death%20of%20Chatterton%20is,now%20in%20Tate%20Britain%2C%20London.&text=The%20Tate%20painting%20measures%2062.2,and%20was%20completed%20in%201856).\]

However, the production of a book is usually a much more collaborative affair than we realize or acknowledge. In choosing subject matter and treatment, authors are influenced by earlier works, by the advice of those with whom they share drafts of their work, and by the intellectual and cultural currents of their times and places. During the publication process, a book is shaped by editors, publishers, readers, and the material circumstances of printing and binding. \[link to story of Thoreau’s editors here?\]

\[Snipped: analogy with more process-public creative forms like music, film. Let’s find another place for this.\]

\#\#Mysteries of Manuscripts

Some manuscripts represent stages in the process of making printed products--books, magazines, articles. Thoreau’s handwritten drafts of Walden give you seven examples of this. \[link to Huntington landing page\]

Other manuscripts are the end products of their creators’ work: diaries and journals and letters are examples.

While printed books are usually produced in quantity, each manuscript is unique, and each one has its own challenges. If a book is in a language you know, you just sit right down and read it. With a manuscript, not so much.

Understanding the handwriting is the first adventure, and the older the manuscript, the more complex your quest to read it will be. For ancient, medieval, and pre-modern manuscripts, you have to learn to read new forms of writing, if not new languages. You’ll find entertaining examples in English from the pre-modern period at The National Archives [<span class="underline">Palaeography tutorial (how to read old handwriting)</span>](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/palaeography/default.htm). \[Note: I really like this site, but it uses Adobe Flash to provide the zoom feature for the MSS, and Flash is going away his year.\]

Thoreau’s Walden MSS are filled with examples of handwriting as a barrier to understanding \[give some examples here or single words or phrases\]. There is nothing quite so satisfying as pulling at an illegible knot of handwriting until you’ve untangled the threads and laid them out into letters and words\!

An unsigned manuscript presents another kind of mystery. If it’s part of a collection, you may find clues to the author in the other material in the collection; if it’s solitary, you may have to rely on the contents or the handwriting, or both. \[I’ve been asked to authenticate Thoreau’s handwriting on several occasions: I could give an example. Any others?\]

\[Note: there are also manuscript books, of course, as this review [<span class="underline">https://muse.jhu.edu/article/655634</span>](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/655634) reminded me. This is probably not the place for even a brief mention of these, but in the history of scholarly editing we might mention the scroll and the codex, and note that there’s a connection between book history and editing\]

\[Note: Expand conclusion, below, to cover both books and MSS: use texts to do that: book and MSS both present us with texts, DSE is about editing texts

> Textual scholarship is predicated on the understanding that the texts of works are essentially different from the texts of documents. Texts of works have no physical substance; they are represented or conveyed more or less precisely or correctly by the texts of documents.\]

\#\#Investigating Books and Manuscripts

These modules offer the tools of scholarly editing--and in particular, of digital scholarly editing--as a way to investigate the secrets of books and the mysteries of manuscripts.

Scholarly editing is a kind of historical detective work that aims to discover, interpret, and reveal the lives a text has led. Scholarly editing is, itself, a complex and messy process: it asks questions about who made a particular text, where that text came from, and how and why it took the form that it did in order to tell a fuller story of what a particular text *is*.

But why might we *want* to do all this digging to uncover a text’s history in the first place? What do we gain from the process of scholarly editing? As these modules will show, scholarly editing involves coming to *know* a text in a different way than we would by simply reading that text. By exploring the creative layers that constitute a text and by tracing the transformations that a text undergoes, we get *closer* to that text. This might mean that we learn more about an author’s thinking about that text. It might mean that we revisit what we thought we knew about the cultural moment or time period that generated our text. It might mean that we connect to creative traces that aren’t visible in the published version of a text but that stand as testament to the intricacies and beauty of thinking in and with words.

So, if you’ve ever thrilled at the deletion scratches in an author’s handwritten draft, or wondered about the differences between various editions of a book, or been curious about how editorial decisions are made, welcome to the world of (digital) scholarly editing\!

Even if you have no plans to become a scholarly editor yourself, then, what you’ll learn in these modules is to ask questions of the textual artifacts you encounter in the world, whatever their origins. You’ll learn to think about texts as fluid, living entities. And you’ll do so with Walden’s messy, marvelous history as your guide.

  - ## What is scholarly editing?

Scholarly editing is a form of text editing in which the goal is to present a particular version of a text, accompanied by evidence about that version. Scholarly editing differs from other kinds of editing because it’s based on a historical view of the text involved. The history of composition, editing, and publication of the text are all researched and taken into account by the scholarly editor.

  - ## The tradition of scholarly editing

The history of textual criticism, which includes scholarly editing, ranges from scholars at the Great Library of Alexandria who recovered, studied, and preserved the works of antiquity in the third and second centuries BCE to present-day specialists in encoding and digital representation who aim to provide open access to rare and unique materials. The form in which the edited text is presented has changed with technology, from the handwritten scroll and codex, to type printed on parchment then paper, to characters entered into a computer file and stored in a numerical code that allows users to both reproduce and manipulate them.

The method a scholarly editor uses depends on both the nature of the text to be edited and the desired outcome.

      - > I’m going to move this.

Book and article manuscripts are often edited in preparation for publication, in order to clarify the author’s meaning, to bring the writing into conformity with a particular standard, to attract a particular audience, or to achieve some combination of all of these.

The most extensive type of manuscript editing is developmental editing, in which structure as well as content are reviewed and revised. If developmental editing is necessary, it usually takes place before a manuscript is accepted for publication.

Copyediting or line editing is a close review of a manuscript for accuracy of content and consistency of style (following standard rules of capitalization, spelling, punctuation, and so on).

Proofreading takes place after a manuscript has been typeset, in order to eliminate errors before publication. Typeset copy is read for sense, and also against the final version of the manuscript to discover illogical, garbled, repeated, or missing text.

      - > selecting text for an edition: for what kind of audience? Selections of critical responses and/or contemporary pieces and/or letters by author, etc.

  - ## Editing to recover

Some scholarly editing performs literary recovery by creating a modern edition of a text that explores its place in history. Textual recovery has been important to studies of literature by women, African American, and Native American authors, for example, as the work of scholarly editing contributes to the reconstruction of literary history. Examples of textual recovery include digital projects such as *Just Teach One* and print editions such as Broadview Editions and the Rutgers University Press American Women Writers Series. The scholarly editing involved in textual recovery can involve selecting texts that provide contexts for reading. Textual recovery can focus upon manuscripts, periodicals, and other media that may have been overlooked or difficult to access as objects of study.

  - ## The experience of scholarly editing

Thinking as a scholarly editor

Reading as a scholarly editor

Scholarly editing begins with reading, in order to identify significant versions of the text to be edited and to understand the levels of authority of those versions. There are several ways to read: see the discussion of close reading, hyper reading, machine reading, and metareading at [<span class="underline">https://github.com/milnegeneseo/digital-scholarly-editing/blob/master/scholEditing\_intro/varieties-of-reading.md</span>](https://github.com/milnegeneseo/digital-scholarly-editing/blob/master/scholEditing_intro/varieties-of-reading.md). When you read as a scholarly editor, you make use of all of these approaches, but metareading predominates: you are reading in order to learn and then say something about the text not only as a piece of writing but as an object with a history. Learning as much as you can about how the text was created and revised and used by the author and others will inform your decisions about how to edit it and how to explain those decisions.

In practice, this means that you scrutinize the text character by character, and you attend to the features of the physical document for the information they convey. For a manuscript, these features include the type of paper (size, color, presence of stationer’s marks or watermarks), the writing medium (ink or pencil or crayon and the color of each), and evidence of use or damage (for example, folds, pin holes, rust marks from paper clips, stains, or tears). For a printed text, you want to understand the method of production; significant physical features of a printed text include the type of paper, the typeface(s) employed, and the binding.

You also study the author’s diction, experience, culture, education, passions and beliefs, biography, and milieu in the largest sense, and you take into account their other writings, public and private.

Writing as a scholarly editor

Precise and unambiguous description and reporting

In editing a text that has more than one version, in manuscript or in print or in both, you compare the versions you’ve identified as authoritative and compile lists of the variants between and among these versions. You use those lists of variants to choose and if necessary emend a version that represents the form of the text that meets your editorial goal.

  - ## What is digital scholarly editing?

In digital scholarly editing, electronic tools are used to present a particular version of a text and evidence about that version. The ability to encode information electronically transformed the presentation of the edited text from a static product--the book or article--into a dynamic one, a file made up of data that can be both reproduced and manipulated by anyone with access to it.

What to watch out for: digital lets you put too much in.

## 

Digital scholarly editing (DSE) involves the application of computing technologies to all stages of scholarly editing—it is at once a continuation of and a departure from print-based scholarly editing practices. On the one hand, the involvement of the digital has not changed the fundamental principles with which editors approach scholarly editing; in fact, the scale of digitization makes editorial interpretation and intervention all the more vital as a guide to the meaning of those cultural artifacts that are now more widely viewable. On the other hand, digital tools make possible new kinds of historical and textual analysis, which, in turn, influence the development of more digital scholarly tools. \[Need to account for the fact that digital scholarly editing tools evolve as needs do—that’s what this project is doing, in fact. Digital tools are not simply inert things, invented in isolation, that are applied to pre-existing texts.\] This section will introduce some of the novel features/affordances of DSE.

## 

Perhaps the most distinctive feature of digital scholarly editing (in comparison to print-based scholarly editing) is that it allows for the separation of interpretive work done by an editor from the public-facing forms publication and circulation of that work. What this means is that an editor can focus on evaluating/deciding on/assessing important features of a text or manuscript without worrying about what the final version of an edition of that text or manuscript will look like.

To understand the significance of this feature of DSE, let’s look at a historical example. Teena Rochfort Smith was part of a 19th-century Shakespeare fan club called the New Shakspere Society; one of the group’s projects was to experiment with new ways of printing Shakespeare’s plays. Rochfort Smith decided to tackle *Hamlet*, a play with a complicated textual origin story, as there exists no single, authoritative, approved-by-Shakespeare-himself version of *Hamlet*. Instead, textual scholars have to make do with three early printed versions of the play: the first quarto, published in 1603; the second quarto, published in 1604/5; and the version collected in the First Folio edition of Shakespeare’s plays, published in 1623. These three *Hamlet*s differ from each other, sometimes substantially—the first quarto is so different from the other two, in fact, that it’s often called the “bad quarto.” (Rude.) Every edition of *Hamlet* that presents a single text, therefore, has done some behind-the-scenes grappling with these variations and chosen an editorial logic by which choices between variations were made.

Rochford Smith decided on a different approach: she designed an edition that showed all three early versions of *Hamlet* at once, plus a “Revized Text” of her own design. She called this *A Four-Text Edition of Shakspere’s Hamlet*. \[Somewhere include link to [<span class="underline">Folger images of the edition</span>](https://luna.folger.edu/luna/servlet/view/search?search=SUBMIT&q=hamlet+four-text&dateRangeStart=&dateRangeEnd=&sort=call_number%2Cmpsortorder1%2Ccd_title%2Cimprint&QuickSearchA=QuickSearchA).\] TRS wanted to show the [<span class="underline">fluidity</span>](https://www.press.umich.edu/12020/fluid_text) of Hamlet’s life as a text. She came up with a system of codes that would visually represent the relationship between these different versions: it involved “four different kinds of ink and three different kinds of underline,” among other creative uses of type, to show these differences.

Unfortunately, the technology of her time couldn’t keep up with TRS’s vision: “The plan proved too elaborate for the printer, who, though he used six varieties of type, could not show in the same word perhaps three differences which the Editress wisht him to; and the preparation of more simplified ‘copy’ became necessary” (Furnivall 5). The visual interpretation that TRS wanted to display, in other words, *couldn’t be printed*, and because print was really the only option she had to present her editorial work, she had to adjust to the limitations of printing in the 1880s.

So, TRS adjusted her visual coding system to work within the bounds of print technology. Here’s a sample of the code she devised to represent the first, “bad” quarto:

![Teena Rochfort Smith's explanation of the visual codes she used to print the first quarto of Hamlet. The coding is described in detail in the following paragraph. ](media/image2.png)

To show the differences between the first quarto (called Q1), the second quarto (called Q2) and the First Folio (F1), TRS used the darker Clarendon font to show words and phrases in Q1 that differ from *both* Q2 and F1 and italic small capitals to show words and phrases in Q1 that differ from *only one* of the other two early versions.

![Teena Rochfort Smith's explanation of the visual codes she shared between the first quarto, the second quarto, and the First Folio of Hamlet. This coding system is described in detail in the following paragraph. ](media/image4.png)

TRS also used an asterisk to mark any lines that existed in only one of these early texts, an upward-pointing caret to show where letters, words, or sentences present in the other versions are *not* present in the version at hand, and a section sign for any “confusion” in the text. Let’s see what this system of visual coding looks like in action:

\[More soon\]...

POINT HERE: 1) to show what encoding-stuck-with-output looks like and 2) to offer an on-ramp to the concept of encoding.

\[More soon\]…

In TRS’s non-digital mode of scholarly editing, she had to commit to one single output—the printed book, and this fact limited how she interpreted her texts.

In more technical terms, digital scholarly editing separates encoding and output.

This incredible **flexibility of output** means something very important about how we think about a text: it allows for **less “authoritative”** versions of texts to be produced. Previous situation: scholarly editing has tended towards the authoritative (TRS sort of trying to escape that tendency). That is to say, a scholarly editor presents a single version of a text that that particular editor is most committed to for one reason or another. Kind of One True Version, in a sense. The flexibility of output associated with digital scholarly editing, by contrast, can allow for a more open-ended edition. This has all sort of wonderful implications for how we as readers get to experience a text. \[Link to Shelley’s Frankenstein in Juxta form and/or Walden fluid edition make.\] Expand idea of the fluid text here, for sure.

\[**PORTABILITY** OF OUTPUT as a slightly different sort of thing. Move from encoding to output is one thing; moving from output directly to another kind of output is a different thing altogether. Beth’s typewriting-to-Word experience in here, maybe?.\]

\[Finally, digital scholarly editing allows for very collaborative kinds of editing processes. Take Amanda Visconti’s Ulysses as a kind of open-ended annotation project. Or offer a transcription project as an example? But also all kinds of other opportunities that aren’t just about crowd-sourcing. This version of Walden, for example\!

\- crowdsourcing and the social edition.

\- other kinds of collaboration?\]

There is one more thing to say about digital scholarly editing as it exists today. One more definition, perhaps, or one more way of thinking about what scholarly editing is. Scholarly editing of the digital, in other words. Digital scholarly editing can refer to the scholarly editing of born-digital materials. We’ve been talking about writers who drafted, revised, and edited on paper before publishing various versions of their texts also on paper. However, a writer in this day and age is likely to do most of that drafting, revising, and editing on a computer, rather than on scraps of paper or in a notebook. Journals, back-and-forth discussions with readers and editors, etc., are just as likely to happen in digital form like email rather than in letters or paper journals. This means that scholarly investigation of these materials needs to happen by doing all that detective work in another realm—the digital. And what about other kinds of digital artifacts that might be of interest to cultural scholars? Computer games are uniquely modern artifacts—what might a scholar need to be able to study code in the future? And what about the annotations that people make in eBooks? How to recover and explore those? Lots to think about—point towards Alan Galey’s work here. Social media archives will be important to explore at some point. And what about something that isn’t strictly literary—some kind of science-y exploration in textual/revised form, maybe?

### \#Introduction to Scholarly Editing

#### \#\#Editing in a General Sense

Editing is used in a general sense to describe a process of selection and arrangement resulting in a product.

In these modules, we’ll be discussing editing manuscripts and books, but the practice has broader applications. You can edit a movie, an image, a sound recording, or even a gene. The principles and practices involved in each of these cases are quite different, of course, and each requires different technologies, but in all cases you are making decisions that determine the contents of the finished product.

#### \#\#Editing to Improve: It Can Require Scholarship, but It Differs from Scholarly Editing

Editing is often done to improve a thing in some way, to make it more useful and valuable. For example, gene editing can repair faulty DNA sequences or correct harmful mutations, and film editing can produce a more enjoyable movie.

Book and article manuscripts are often edited in preparation for publication, in order to clarify the author’s meaning, to bring the writing into conformity with a particular standard, to attract a particular audience, or to achieve some combination of all of these.

> \>The most extensive type of manuscript editing is developmental editing, in which structure as well as content are reviewed and revised. If developmental editing is necessary, it takes place before a manuscript is accepted for publication.
> 
> \>Copyediting or line editing is a close review of a manuscript for accuracy of content and consistency of style (following standard rules of capitalization, spelling, punctuation, and so on).
> 
> \>Proofreading takes place after a manuscript has been typeset, in order to eliminate errors before publication. Typeset copy is read for sense, and also against the final version of the manuscript to discover illogical, garbled, repeated, or missing text.
>

\[Add in some form: Thoreau had several run-ins with editors who were bent on cleaning up his work for their audiences: George William Curtis, “An Excursion to Canada,” (\*Putnam’s\*, January 1853); George William Curtis, "Wellfleet Oysterman" in \*Cape Cod\* (June 1855); James Russell Lowell, "Chesuncook" in \*Maine Woods\* (\*Atlantic\*, June 1858); . . .\]

\#\#Editing as Selecting Groups of Texts

Editing also refers to the selection of a group of writings to be published as a collection. This process usually does not involve changing the contents of the pieces that are selected. Examples include collections of quotations from individual authors, or of essays on a particular topic. The Norton Critical Editions comprises a series of collections designed for students and teachers; Houghton Mifflin's Best American series brings together short fiction and nonfiction for general readers.

#### \#\#Scholarly Editing

Scholarly editing is a form of text editing in which the goal is to present a particular version of a text, accompanied by evidence about that version. Scholarly editing differs from other kinds of editing because it’s based on a historical view of the text involved. The history of composition, editing, and publication of the text are all researched and taken into account by the scholarly editor.

\[From Caroline: Some scholarly editing performs literary recovery by creating a modern edition of a text that explores its place in history. Textual recovery has been important to studies of literature by women, African American, and Native American authors, for example, as the work of scholar editing contributes to the reconstruction of literary history. Examples of textual recovery include digital projects such as *Just Teach One* and print editions such as Broadview Editions and the Rutgers University Press American Women Writers Series. The scholarly editing involved in textual recovery can involve selecting texts that provide contexts for reading. Textual recovery can focus upon manuscripts, periodicals, and other media that may have been overlooked or difficult to access as objects of study.\]

Scholarly editing is one of the ways of investigating texts and their histories that is included in the activity called textual criticism.

{Tanselle: “Textual criticism, the attempt to determine the relations among surviving texts of a work and the evaluation of their reliability as witnesses, has generally been undertaken with a view to reconstructing, as accurately as possible, the text finally intended by the author.” (“Varieties,” p. 16)}

\[From Caroline:

Understanding the many layers of scholarly editing in the creation of a print or digital text invites us to engage in sustained reflection about a text’s dependence upon larger material and social infrastructures—from the pen, ink, and paper of a nineteenth-century manuscript to TEI tags today. Archival research, whether in physical or digital archives, enables us to approach a literary work not merely as disembodied “text,” but also as a cultural artifact produced and preserved in a social context. We can explore not only the author’s composition process, but also the roles that editors, critics, and communities perform—vital, ongoing work that is often effaced or demeaned as “secondary” and peripheral.

As texts migrate from brick-and-mortar archives to digital formats, it may seem less important to create editions that make literary works *accessible*, but there are renewed imperatives for scholars to negotiate the vast abundance of texts and different versions of them. The navigational skills of editors have arguably become more and not less important, in other words, given the vast troves of digital texts—artifacts that may be viewable out of context, broken into pieces, or partly obscured. Scholarly editing aims to place texts in sharper perspective, expand their claim upon contemporary audiences, and reinvigorate ongoing conversations about their meaning. By modeling digital research skills and interpretive frameworks for reading a nineteenth-century text, this project seeks to illuminate the work that editors perform—in manuscript, print, and digital media—as well as its larger social value.\]

{NB: I think we should make a distinction between archives and editions; after I’ve done that I’ll make some revisions to the above. BW}\]

Some Definitions of Scholarly Editing

Peter Shillingsburg, quoted in Darcy Cullen's "Introduction" to \*Editors, Scholars, and the Social Text\* (U of Toronto Press, 2010)

The term scholarly editor is used in this volume to refer to scholars who prepare scholarly editions of classical or literary works. Most scholarly editors are also 'textual scholars,' that is, scholars who are interested in manuscript studies and, as Peter Shillingsburg explains, work 'to find and analyze all the evidence of authorship, editing, copying, printing, and distribution for a textual work in order to discover the agency, authenticity, and purpose of textual variation and the significance of variant material forms of textual conveyance. Textual scholarship might result in a history of the text, a newly edited text, or a critical essay employing textual history as evidence influencing interpretation.

\#\#Works, Texts, and Documents in Scholarly Editing

Textual scholarship is predicated on the understanding that the texts of works are essentially different from the texts of documents. Texts of works have no physical substance; they are represented or conveyed more or less precisely or correctly by the texts of documents.

Example of the divergence of text of work and text of document: The editors of Thoreau’s handwritten Journal are often faced with characters or words that are difficult to decipher. They use the surrounding passage as well as familiarity with Thoreau’s orthography and his vocabulary to help them decide what he meant to write, and they can usually figure it out. Once in a while, though, Thoreau’s intention remains mysterious, as in the following example.

At the end of a Journal entry dated August 24, 1851, Thoreau wrote

> The Capsules of the Iris versicolor or blue flag are now ready for humming.
> 
> Except he didn’t quite write “humming”: he wrote a word that seems to begin with “h” and end with “ing”, but the middle of the word is just a series of humps. \[add image\] In this case, the context provides no help. The editors of \*Journal 4: 1851-1852\*, in which this sentence is published, settled on “humming”, but there’s no way to know for sure what Thoreau had in mind (PUP, 1992, p. 13). We have the text, but the work is elusive.

When we read, we use the sequence of characters in the text of a document to reconstruct the work: the scholarly editor reads in a particular way, examining and questioning the text of a document to determine its relationship to the text of the work it represents and to document that relationship in an edition. In varieties-of-reading.md, the kind of reading in which we are “looking to say something \*about\* a text” is called metareading.

\[Resources\]

#### \#\#Scholarly Editing and Metareading

When you read as a scholarly editor, you make use of metareading in order to understand the levels of authority of existing versions and to decide how best to present the text.

In editing a text that exists in a single manuscript, you read every character. As you read you bring into play as much as you know about the author’s diction, experience, culture, education, passions and beliefs, biography, and milieu in the largest sense, and about their other writings, public and private.

You also read the features of the physical document for the unique information they convey about that document: you attend to paper, writing mediums, stains, tears, stationer’s marks, watermarks, pin holes, rust marks from paper clips.

In editing a text that has more than one version, in manuscript or in print or in both, you compare the versions you’ve identified as authoritative and compile lists of the variants between and among these versions. You use those lists of variants to choose and if necessary emend a version that represents the form of the text that meets your editorial goal.

You do all of this to understand what the work means not only as a piece of writing but as an object with a history. You want to know as much as you can about how it was created and revised and used by the author and others, to inform your decisions about how to edit it and to justify those decisions.

\[Resources\]

#### \#\#Approaches to Scholarly Editing

Before the editorial work begins, it’s important to consider what approach best suits the nature of the text to be edited and the audience you want to reach. In a 1995 piece titled “The Varieties of Scholarly Editing,” textual critic and bibliographer G. Thomas Tanselle discusses the following useful categories of approaches, each based on fundamental decisions about altering the documentary text that inform the ensuing process.

You may choose to reproduce a text as it existed at a particular moment in time \*without altering it\*, either as a facsimile or in a diplomatic transcription. Each of these choices requires informed editorial decisions.

For a facsimile of a published text, you have to decide what specific surviving copy of the text will be reproduced and by what process that will be done, and an explanation of these decisions is an essential part of the edition. Several facsimile editions exist of Walt Whitman’s 1855 \*Leaves of Grass,\* for example. In a [<span class="underline">review</span>](https://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1373&context=wwqr) of the facsimile produced by the Library of American Poets in 1992, Ed Folsom, a noted Whitman scholar, compares it with three previous facsimiles and explains why he finds the 1992 facsimile superior.

\[Exercise: High-res digital photography and the development of the World Wide Web made it possible for libraries and research centers to make available facsimiles of items in their collections, both books and manuscripts. The [<span class="underline">Open Archives Initiative</span>](https://www.openarchives.org/), part of the open access movement which began in the 1990s, has supported this initiative. The Walt Whitman Archive provides [<span class="underline">links</span>](https://whitmanarchive.org/published/LG/) to images of the six American editions of \*Leaves of Grass\* plus what’s called the deathbed edition. Do you think these facsimiles are editions in themselves? Why or why not? What uses do facsimile editions serve?\]

You may decide to create a diplomatic transcription, in which the features of the original, usually a handwritten document, are reproduced as faithfully as possible in a more legible form than the original, usually a typescript. In this case, you will not be deliberately altering the text, but you will be making editorial decisions that involve not only interpreting the characters in the document, but also presenting similar characters consistently throughout the transcription.

Note that making a diplomatic transcription can be one step in creating an edition that incorporates deliberate editorial alterations.

\[Use a leaf of the Walden MS and a transcript of it to illustrate this, and discuss necessary decisions.\]

\[Exercise: Link to an image of a MS page \[offer several\], transcribe it, and discuss the decisions you have to make as you transcribe: lineation, punctuation, capital letters, vertical spacing, indentation, etc. What audience would find a diplomatic transcription important?\]

{Discuss Fluid-text editions here, I think}

You may choose to \*alter\* the text in the document to present a particular Introduce alteration

> In works viewed as products of individuals
> 
> Texts as originally intended
> 
> Intermediate version(s)
> 
> Finally intended texts

\[Example here will be Bradley Dean’s reconstructions of two lecture versions, “What Shall It Profit?” and “Life Misspent,” of what was posthumously published as the essay “Life without Principle,” and “LwP as it appears in \*Reform Papers,\* ed. Wendell Glick. Discussion of copy-text editing will be part of this.

> Editors of published texts have a more complex set of decisions to make in determining how the text and the work relate. From the period during which the text was being conceived of and composed, handwritten or typed notes, indexes, outlines, drafts, and fair copies are all significant. Records of conversations with friends and collaborators, correspondence with editors, and contracts with publishers may provide significant evidence. Setting copy and marked proofsheets are very important witnesses to authorial intention, as are authorially marked published copies.\]
> 
> In works viewed as collaborative products
> 
> Publishers’ or others’ texts

\[Example: Thomas Wolfe’s last novels. See [<span class="underline">Halberstadt’s 1981 letter to the NYRB</span>](https://www.nybooks.com/articles/1981/03/19/who-wrote-thomas-wolfes-last-novels/), for a start.\]

> Texts available to readers at given times

\[Need example

For a more thorough, nuanced, and historically oriented discussion of these basic approaches, see G. Thomas Tanselle, "The Varieties of Scholarly Editing," in \*Scholarly Editing: A Guide to Research\*, ed. D.C. Greetham (1995), pp. 9-32.

{Fiona and Caroline: I haven’t touched on the world of Classical and biblical editing--should that be discussed? It has its own concerns and methods, and a thorough coverage would include paleography, scribal transmission, stemmatics, etc. See

#### \#\#BW: ~~Traditional~~ Pre-Digital vs Digital Scholarly Editing 

(Digital Scholarly Editing as part of a longer tradition)

{Fiona and Caroline: How to approach this?}

{FC’s thoughts: would Teena Rochford Smith’s efforts to typeset *Hamlet* be a good anecdote-based introduction to technology as both limit and tool here? Her story contextualizes Digital Scholarly Editing in a useful way by showing that editing has always happened in conversation with available textual technologies. The stages of Ron Clapper’s work would also be fantastically illustrative of the trad-to-digital evolution.}

\- clarify: trad vs digital OR print vs digital?

\- CW: “trad” more like digital than we might think. Network, web: language we have for digital very similar to literary work in 19th c\!

\- concept of markup has heritage in earlier editing practices.

\- NW: production vs publication. In DSE, lots of what you do isn’t tied to a print output. How to talk about being part of a trad AND how that trad has been transformed by digital tools.

\- PS: digital as continuation of tradition. Simplicity of textual transformation as one of the affordances of the digital.

\- EBB: code base might look v. different

\- NW: markup differences (print vs digital) a useful thing to highlight

\-BW: This is where discussion of fluid text editing could go.

\[Fundamental editorial decisions are the same. Different means of recording and presenting those decisions in DSE open up new ways to use the product.\]

#### \#\#Technologies for producing texts

The technologies for producing texts have changed over the years. Common formats for texts are

Autograph MSS, in the hand of the creator

Holograph MSS, handwritten in another hand than that of the creator

Typewritten

Printed from a computer file

Typeset

Wood block

Moveable type

Stereotype

Phototype

\[Printing methods: letterpress and offset and phototype\]

{Use Somewhere?

The true poem is not that which the public read. There is always a poem not printed on paper, coincident with the production of this, stereotyped in the poet’s life. It is *what he has become through his work*. Not how is the idea expressed in stone, or on canvass or paper, is the question, but how far it has obtained form and expression in the life of the writer. His true work will not stand in any prince’s gallery. (A Week, p. 343)

Note that one document can contain texts of more than one work:

Example 1: a single leaf now part of version F/6 of the *Walden* MS contains material for both *Walden* (the sand foliage chapter in "Spring," pp. 304-309) and *The Maine Woods* (a summary of the extent of the voyage made in "Ktaadn," pp. 45-46)

Example 2: the first sheet of the proofs of Walden contains both the printed title page and copyright information and a handwritten note from Thoreau to the publisher.

\#-EBB: Planning ~~Designing~~ a Scholarly Edition

\#\#Preparation

\-BW: move these to a discussion of project management.

Before you begin to design your scholarly edition, you want to consider the following:

> \>What you want to edit, and why the material you’ve chosen is significant enough to warrant the time and effort involved in editing

\>What audience will benefit from your edition

\>What approach will best suit that material (this is the design part)

\>How you will make your edition available

You also want to consider several practical issues. Examples follow each category of issue given below. You will surely come up with more categories and examples as you think through your project.

\>Legal

> For example, Who owns the material you want to edit? Are there restrictions on its use? \[[<span class="underline">copyright</span>](https://norman.hrc.utexas.edu/watch/us.cfm); ownership of a document vs ownership of its contents\] How will you gain access to it? \[policies and practices of research libraries; using original materials; using scanned and digitized materials\]

\>Logistical

> For example, Where will you do your editorial work? What access will you have to supporting materials, both secondary source books and resources available on the Internet? \[CW: Will your project involve others--students, colleagues, librarians, or other community members--who might mutually benefit from collaborating on the editorial work?\]

\>Financial

> What costs will be involved in obtaining copies of the primary and secondary source material you need? If you need assistants, how will they be recruited and compensated?

\>Professional

> Creating an edition of any size or scope will take much more time and effort than you imagine it will at the outset. Are you in a position professionally to commit to such a project? If you are an academic, you need to know how your department evaluates editorial projects for the purposes of promotion and tenure.

\>Personal

> In the first chapter of Walden, Thoreau writes that “the cost of a thing is the amount of what I will call life which is required to be exchanged for it, immediately or in the long run.” There will be a cost to undertaking an editing project; be thoughtful about how much life you want to exchange for it, immediately or in the long run.
