In her essay “How We Read: Close, Hyper, Machine,” N. Katherine Hayles describes three ways of reading. Each has something to offer us. None is the “wrong” way to read.

  - The term *close reading* usually refers to a kind of reading that identifies meaningful patterns in a text — of diction, imagery, symbols, structure, etc. — for the purpose of generating interpretations.
  - The term *hyperreading* can be used to describe a type of reading motivated less by the search for textual meaning than by the need to quickly locate relevant information across multiple sources.
  - Hayles suggests the term *machine reading* for a type of reading that relies on the power of computation: for example, to find meaningful patterns across a corpus that may contain thousands of texts. Perhaps a better term for this type of reading, however, is *distant reading*. After all, long before the advent of cheap, mechanized computation, scholars were counting up the words of authors such as Thomas Aquinas or William Shakespeare to create concordances of their works: indexes designed to help a reader locate in context every instance of a particular word used in the author’s writings.

## Another variety of reading: metareading

Missing from the list above is a type of reading we might call *metareading*. We’re metareading when we’re looking to say something *about* a text: for example, whether it’s a novel or a poem, a sonnet or a haiku, an example of “realism” or “speculative fiction,” of “literary fiction” or “genre fiction,” of fiction or non-fiction.

Here are some other examples of metareading:

  - Attempts to determine **who authored** the poem “A Visit from St. Nicholas” (aka “’Twas the Night Before Christmas”), which was published anonymously in 1837. It's usually attributed to Clement Clark Moore, but note everyone agrees. See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Visit_from_St._Nicholas). (Scroll down to "Authorship controversy.")
  - Attempts to determine which of several versions of a text best represents the **author’s intentions**, including the title of the text itself. See, for example [this note to Thoreau’s essay “Resistance to Civil Government”](https://commons.digitalthoreau.org/civil/a-note-on-the-text/), particularly [the second paragraph](https://commons.digitalthoreau.org/civil/a-note-on-the-text/#pTtdosftoWGpafthieRPvWHDTPUPFietrtaaaphcHWRpoNCEWCDaOsslsvarWshtrtiu) and [this note on the paragraph](https://commons.digitalthoreau.org/civil/a-note-on-the-text/#comment-6).
  - Attempts to determine the **best way to present an author’s work to readers**. For example, virtually all of Emily Dickinson’s poetry was unpublished — in the conventional sense — in her lifetime. She shared and circulated them among different people in different handwritten forms. Printed versions of her poetry often make changes to her original spelling and punctuation. Should they? In addition, as [this effort to construct a critical edition of Dickinson’s correspondences](https://rotunda.upress.virginia.edu/edc/preface.xqy) points out, reading the poems outside their original context can affect how we understand them:

> Published translations of Emily Dickinson’s manuscripts homogenize her various writings so that all letters appear to be of the same ilk, as do all poems. Editions that divide letters from poems and poems from letters elide important aspects of the positions of Dickinson’s poems within epistolary contexts and vice versa. Emily Dickinson blended or embedded poems into the prose in letters; wrote them on separate sheets and enclosed them with letters; wrote poems and sent them as letters, with salutation and signature. In other words, Dickinson’s poems are often part of letters, and poems are often letters or are contextualized by their mutual enclosure in an envelope with a letter. But these poems, letters, and letter-poems are difficult to comprehend when they are stripped from their original context.
